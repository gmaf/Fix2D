# Getting started with 2D Entities Physics

To begin using the 2D Entities Physics package, please refer to Project Tiny’s [System Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8hen2hLFY5FLkC5gd3JP2Z-IpHfnAX-CpYLK3aOdwA/edit#heading=h.od6pqxv78b97) as well as the specific [Requirements](index.html#requirements) for the 2D Entities Physics package, to ensure that you download and install everything necessary to begin creating Project Tiny applications.  

Once you have installed the required Editor version and third party tools, download the pre-configured project template `Tiny2D`from the [ProjectTinySamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ProjectTinySamples) repository. This project comes with Assets, Scripts and a Scene set up for Project Tiny development, so that you can go straight into developing your new Project Tiny application. 

## Enabling Physics

Adding a Rigidbody2D to a GameObject in DOTs is similar to the steps in the regular 2D workflow. Select the GameObject you want to add a Rigidbody2D on to, then in its Inspector window, select **Add Components** and enter ‘Rigidbody2D’ into the search box at the top. Select ‘Rigidbody2D’ to add the component to the GameObject. Drag the new GameObject into the SubScene to include it in the [GameObject conversion](Conversion.md).
